# TagWag-image-caption-generator-app-Flutter
An App that is use to view the things that is in front of us. Its actually an image caption generator app.

Problem Overview:
Blindness makes life rather difficult for people who suffer from this health problem,
but the use of technology can help in some day-to-day tasks. In this context, the
present work focuses the development of a photo-to-speech application for the blind.
Intelligent Eye, as the name suggests, is a technical remedy for the visually impaired
so that they can navigate themselves with their own self without external assistance.
Ideology behind this project is to strike an impact on the society so that visually
backward beings can equalize their status. In this project, we combined both image
and text processing to build a useful deep learning application.

Vision:
Through this technology, it is our vision to help every underprivileged with vision
impairment or MSVI. Developing this technology will be the 1st step towards
innovation.

Solution:
The solution to this problem lies in hardware which can be created by using internet of
things (IOT). Before stepping into IOT, the model should be trained perfectly so that
when the hardware is designed, there is almost no chance of getting a wrong prediction.
In order to do so, we are designing a flutter mobile application which is firstly
compatible with android. It will use camera API and detect what’s in the picture. It will
include 3 phases. By live camera, taking picture from the live camera and uploading a
picture from the mobile.
